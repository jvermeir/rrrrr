# R experiments (and other data manipulation thingies)

Repo to store some experiments in R, and a utility to convert a specific csv file.

## build Java utility

```bash
mvn clean install 
```

## run

```bash
java -jar target/rrrrr-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar data/conversion_table5.csv  
```

output is in `~/conversion_table5_samengevoegd.csv`

## R code

Just a bunch of scripts to try out stuff. May need some tweaking to work properly.
